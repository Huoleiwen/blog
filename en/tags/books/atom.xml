		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’d like to recommend you a book I read the other day. It changed me a lot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the book is Stolen Focus, by John Hari.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, actually, I have read some similar books before, but I changed
nothing, after reading this book, I put my phone down and now I finally have
control over the time I spend browsing social networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book’s subject is something that is affecting all of us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does Attention matter?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author mentioned three reasons why the subject is important for our time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are unable to pay sustained attention, you can’t achieve the things
you want to achieve. When you want to read a book, but you are attracted by
TikTok or Twitter. When you want to spend hours with your kids, but you keep
anxiously checking your email to see if your boss is messaging you. You want
to set up a business, but your life dissolves instead into a blur of Facebook
posts that only make you feel envious and anxious. If this goes on for months
and years, it scrambles your ability to figure out who you are and what you
want. If we want to do what matters in any domain, we have to be able to give
attention to the right things. If we can’t do that, it’s really hard for us
to do anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fracturing of attention isn’t just causing problems for us as
individuals—it’s causing crises in our whole society. As a species, we are
facing a number of unprecedented challenges—like the climate crisis—and,
unlike previous generations, we are mostly not rising to solve our biggest
challenges. Why? Part of the reason, is that when attention breaks down,
problem-solving breaks down too. Solving big problems requires the sustained
focus of many people over many years. Democracy requires the ability of a
population to pay attention long enough to identify real problems,
distinguish them from fantasies, come up with solutions, and hold their
leaders accountable if they fail to deliver them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we understand what happens, then, we can begin to change it. This crisis
is human-made, and it can be unmade by us too. All we have to do is
fundamentally redefine the problem and then take action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the reasons you may need to read this book sometime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
