		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know this book from &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8wLCmDtCDAM&quot;&gt;this video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but actually it’s not my type. It’s basically based by experience not by science.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is the foreword. But it’s not written by the author. Maybe I should read some books written by this guy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within. (The warrior identity that their ideology gives them covers over that chaos.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologies are substitutes for true knowledge, and ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence. Furthermore, when their social contraptions fail to fly, ideologues blame not themselves but all who see through the simplifications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the deepest part of our psyche, we all want to be judged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fact that the meaning of life without positive value is not simply neutral. Because we are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering that is intrinsic to Being. We must have the meaning inherent in a profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes paramount. Then, nihilism beckons, with its hopelessness and despair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
